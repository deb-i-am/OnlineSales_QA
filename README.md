# In Bash-Task4 Folder, 
Since sample.tsv file size is large enough, it couldn't be executed through online emulator.
demo.tsv file is created taking first 100 rows and created output.tsv executing required bash command on that input file.
final.txt contains the line count, SHA-1 hash, and the last 5 lines of the output.tsv content. 
Generated the output.tsv file along with this information in final.txt file


# In Debugging-Task3 folder, 
I have fixed the code after debugging the script in online compiler (python)


# In SQL-Task1,

# In Scripting-Task2,
I have written the script in Google Collab python notebook to fetch the same output replicating SQl-Task1 with the help of pandas
