#In Bash-Task4 Folder, 
# Since sample.tsv file size is large enough, it couldn't be executed through online emulator.
# So demo.tsv file is created taking first 100 rows and created output.tsv executing required bash command on that input file.


# final.txt contains the line count, SHA-1 hash, and the last 5 lines of the output.tsv content. 
# Generated the output.tsv file along with this information in final.txt file
